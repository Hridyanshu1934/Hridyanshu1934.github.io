Excited to share my personal portfolio website 🚀

I recently built and deployed my portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean UI, smooth interactions, and responsive design across devices.

This project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals, improve attention to UI/UX details, and better showcase my projects, skills, and experience in one place.

🔹 Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
🔹 Hosted on: GitHub Pages

I’m actively looking for internship / entry-level opportunities in web development or software roles and would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions.
